# Intelligent Systems - NLP
This repository stores the code related to the NLP practice of the Intelligent Systems course. The dataset used has been obtained from the specialised website Kaggle, and is as follows: [E-Mail classification NLP](https://www.kaggle.com/datatattle/email-classification-nlp?select=SMS_train.csv).

The programming language used was R, and the development environment was R Studio. All the code is concentrated in a single file, called *app-code.R*. It is programmed so that the results shown in the practice document can be replicated by completely executing the code in this file, without the need to do anything additional. 

**NOTE:** It may not work if the necessary R libraries are not installed on the machine where the code is to be executed. For this, simply using the command *install.packages()* with the missing libraries would be sufficient.
